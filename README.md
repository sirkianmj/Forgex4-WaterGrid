A **Digital Twin platform** built to model, simulate, and verify the performance of a novel **Atmospheric Water Harvesting (AWH) fa√ßade system**.

This software is based on my **invention** ‚Äî an *Atmospheric Water Harvesting System for Building Facades using PEG-SiO‚ÇÇ Nanocomposite and Adaptive Mechanisms*.
The concept was formally described in my article on TechRxiv: [DOI: 10.36227/techrxiv.175735328.82069490/v1](https://doi.org/10.36227/techrxiv.175735328.82069490/v1).

The system combines:
- **PEG-SiO‚ÇÇ nanocomposite coatings** to enhance condensation
- **Adaptive fa√ßade mechanisms** to dynamically regulate environmental exposure
- **Digital simulation & verification layers** to model and optimize performance

## üèõÔ∏è Invention & Project Vision

The invention addresses a critical challenge: providing scalable, sustainable water generation in urban environments. By integrating nanomaterials with building facades and augmenting them with adaptive controls, buildings themselves can act as **distributed water harvesting infrastructure**.

**Forgex WaterGrid** turns this invention into a **digital twin simulation platform** ‚Äî making it possible to:
- Forecast water yields based on climate, fa√ßade surface, and adaptive settings
- Compare scenarios across cities and regions
- Provide transparent, verifiable models for municipalities, investors, and policymakers
- Build the foundation for future IoT-enabled fa√ßade systems

This project therefore serves a **dual role**:
1. As the **software expression of my invention**
2. As the **first digital twin ecosystem** for decentralized atmospheric water harvesting
